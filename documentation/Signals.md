# Signals

## Digital 

> A digital signal is a signal that represents a sequence of discrete values. A logic signal is a digital signal with only two possible values, and describes an arbitrary bit stream. Other types of digital signals can represent three-valued logic or higher valued logics. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal)

## Analog

> An analog signal has a theoretically infinite resolution. In practice an analog signal is subject to electronic noise and distortion introduced by communication channels and signal processing operations, which can progressively degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
