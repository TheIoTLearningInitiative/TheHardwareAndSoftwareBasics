# Electronic Components

# Resistor

> A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. Resistors may be used to reduce current flow, and, at the same time, may act to lower voltage levels within circuits. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to limit current flow, to adjust signal levels, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines among other uses.

# Pull-Up & Pull-Down Resistors

> In electronic logic circuits, a pull-up resistor is a resistor connected between a signal conductor and a positive power supply voltage to ensure that the signal will be a valid logic level if external devices are disconnected or high-impedance is introduced. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor)

> A pull-down resistor works in the same way but is connected to ground. It holds the logic signal at a low logic level when no other active device is connected.

# Capacitor

> A capacitor (originally known as a condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store electrical energy temporarily in an electric field. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor)
