## Processor Design

> Processor design is the design engineering task of creating a microprocessor, a component of computer hardware. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_design)

## MicroProcessor

> A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.

### Central processing unit (CPU)

> The control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single integrated circuit called a microprocessor. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)

### General Purpose Processor

> General purpose means it is not designed for any specialized purpose

## Control Unit

> The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic/logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to a program's instructions. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_unit)

## Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

> An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise logical operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit)

## Semiconductor Memory

> Semiconductor memory is an electronic data storage device, often used as computer memory, implemented on a semiconductor-based integrated circuit. It is made in many different types and technologies. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_memory)

## Input/output (I/O)

> In computing, input/output or I/O (or, informally, io or IO) is the communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)
