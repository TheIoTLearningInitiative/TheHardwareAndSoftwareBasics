# Computer

## Central processing unit (CPU)

> The control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single integrated circuit called a microprocessor. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)

# Control Unit

> The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic/logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to a program's instructions. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_unit)

# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

> An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise logical operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit)

# Semiconductor Memory

> Semiconductor memory is an electronic data storage device, often used as computer memory, implemented on a semiconductor-based integrated circuit. It is made in many different types and technologies. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_memory)

# Input/output (I/O)

> In computing, input/output or I/O (or, informally, io or IO) is the communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)
