# Electricity

> Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge. Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction and electric current. In addition, electricity permits the creation and reception of electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves. [Wikipedia](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity)

## Voltage

> Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension (formally denoted ∆V or ∆U, but more often simply as V or U, for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's laws) is the difference in electric potential energy between two points per unit electric charge. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage)

## Current

> An electric current is a flow of electric charge. In electric circuits this charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire. It can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte, or by both ions and electrons such as in a plasma. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current)

## Resistance

> The electrical resistance of an electrical conductor is a measure of the difficulty to pass an electric current through that conductor. The inverse quantity is electrical conductance, and is the ease with which an electric current passes. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance)
