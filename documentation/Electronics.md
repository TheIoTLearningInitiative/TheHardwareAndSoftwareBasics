# Electricity

> Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge. Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction and electric current. In addition, electricity permits the creation and reception of electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves. [Wikipedia](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity)

# Circuit

> Welcome to circuits 101! One of the first things you’ll encounter when learning about electronics is the concept of a circuit. This tutorial will explain what a circuit is, as well as discuss voltage in further detail. [What is a Circuit?](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit)

## Electrical Network

> An electrical network is an interconnection of electrical components (e.g. batteries, resistors, inductors, capacitors, switches) or a model of such an interconnection, consisting of electrical elements (e.g. voltage sources, current sources, resistances, inductances, capacitances). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network)

## Voltage

> Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension (formally denoted ∆V or ∆U, but more often simply as V or U, for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's laws) is the difference in electric potential energy between two points per unit electric charge. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage)

## Current

> An electric current is a flow of electric charge. In electric circuits this charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire. It can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte, or by both ions and electrons such as in a plasma. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current)


# Serial and Parallel Circuits

> Components of an electrical circuit or electronic circuit can be connected in many different ways. The two simplest of these are called series and parallel and occur frequently. Components connected in series are connected along a single path, so the same current flows through all of the components. Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each component. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits)

# Pull-Up & Pull-Down Resistors

> In electronic logic circuits, a pull-up resistor is a resistor connected between a signal conductor and a positive power supply voltage to ensure that the signal will be a valid logic level if external devices are disconnected or high-impedance is introduced. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor)

> A pull-down resistor works in the same way but is connected to ground. It holds the logic signal at a low logic level when no other active device is connected.

# Signals

## Digital 

> A digital signal is a signal that represents a sequence of discrete values. A logic signal is a digital signal with only two possible values, and describes an arbitrary bit stream. Other types of digital signals can represent three-valued logic or higher valued logics. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal)

## Analog

> An analog signal has a theoretically infinite resolution. In practice an analog signal is subject to electronic noise and distortion introduced by communication channels and signal processing operations, which can progressively degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
