# Electronics

## Voltage

> Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension (formally denoted ∆V or ∆U, but more often simply as V or U, for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's laws) is the difference in electric potential energy between two points per unit electric charge. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage)

## Current

> An electric current is a flow of electric charge. In electric circuits this charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire. It can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte, or by both ions and electrons such as in a plasma. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current)

## Resistor

> A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. Resistors may be used to reduce current flow, and, at the same time, may act to lower voltage levels within circuits. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to limit current flow, to adjust signal levels, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines among other uses.

## Capacitor

> A capacitor (originally known as a condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store electrical energy temporarily in an electric field. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor)

## Electrical Network

> An electrical network is an interconnection of electrical components (e.g. batteries, resistors, inductors, capacitors, switches) or a model of such an interconnection, consisting of electrical elements (e.g. voltage sources, current sources, resistances, inductances, capacitances). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network)

## Serial and Parallel Circuits

> Components of an electrical circuit or electronic circuit can be connected in many different ways. The two simplest of these are called series and parallel and occur frequently. Components connected in series are connected along a single path, so the same current flows through all of the components. Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each component. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits)

## Pull-Up Resistors

> In electronic logic circuits, a pull-up resistor is a resistor connected between a signal conductor and a positive power supply voltage to ensure that the signal will be a valid logic level if external devices are disconnected or high-impedance is introduced. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor)
