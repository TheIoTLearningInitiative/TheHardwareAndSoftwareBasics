## MicroProcessor

> A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.

### General Purpose Processor

> General purpose means it is not designed for any specialized purpose

## MicroController

> A microcontroller (or MCU, short for microcontroller unit) is a small computer (SoC) on a single integrated circuit containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of Ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a typically small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications consisting of various discrete chips. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller)

## Field Programmable Gate Array

> A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing – hence "field-programmable". The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). (Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs, but this is increasingly rare.) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)

## Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)

## Floating-point Processing Units (FPUs)

## Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)


## Printed Circuit Board

> A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate. Components — capacitors, resistors or active devices — are generally soldered on the PCB. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)

### Memory

### Analog Digital Converter

>  An analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, A–D, or A-to-D) is a device that converts a continuous physical quantity (usually voltage) to a digital number that represents the quantity's amplitude. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter)

# Embedded Systems

> An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors are manufactured as components of embedded systems. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system)
