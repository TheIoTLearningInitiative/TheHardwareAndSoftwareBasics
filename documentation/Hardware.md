## MicroProcessor

> A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.

### General Purpose Processor

> General purpose means it is not designed for any specialized purpose

## MicroController

> A microcontroller (or MCU, short for microcontroller unit) is a small computer (SoC) on a single integrated circuit containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of Ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a typically small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications consisting of various discrete chips. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller)

## Field Programmable Gate Array

> A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing – hence "field-programmable". The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). (Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs, but this is increasingly rare.) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)

## Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)

> A graphics processing unit (GPU), also occasionally called visual processing unit (VPU), is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)

## Floating-point Processing Units (FPUs)

> A floating-point unit (FPU, colloquially a math coprocessor) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating point numbers. Typical operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and bitshifting. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit)

## Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)

> A digital signal processor (DSP) is a specialized microprocessor (or a SIP block), with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of digital signal processing. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor)

## Printed Circuit Board

> A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate. Components — capacitors, resistors or active devices — are generally soldered on the PCB. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)

### Semiconductor Memory

> Semiconductor memory is an electronic data storage device, often used as computer memory, implemented on a semiconductor-based integrated circuit. It is made in many different types and technologies. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_memory)

### Analog Digital Converter

>  An analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, A–D, or A-to-D) is a device that converts a continuous physical quantity (usually voltage) to a digital number that represents the quantity's amplitude. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter)

### Digital Analog Converter

### Sensors

> In the broadest definition, a sensor is an object whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment, and then provide a corresponding output. A sensor is a type of transducer; sensors may provide various types of output, but typically use electrical or optical signals. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor)
