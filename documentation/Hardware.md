## Field Programmable Gate Array

> A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing – hence "field-programmable". The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). (Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs, but this is increasingly rare.) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)

## Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)

> A graphics processing unit (GPU), also occasionally called visual processing unit (VPU), is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)

## Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

> An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise logical operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit)

## Floating-point Processing Units (FPUs)

> A floating-point unit (FPU, colloquially a math coprocessor) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating point numbers. Typical operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and bitshifting. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit)

## Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)

> A digital signal processor (DSP) is a specialized microprocessor (or a SIP block), with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of digital signal processing. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor)

## Printed Circuit Board

> A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate. Components — capacitors, resistors or active devices — are generally soldered on the PCB. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)

### Semiconductor Memory

> Semiconductor memory is an electronic data storage device, often used as computer memory, implemented on a semiconductor-based integrated circuit. It is made in many different types and technologies. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_memory)

### Analog Digital Converter

>  An analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, A–D, or A-to-D) is a device that converts a continuous physical quantity (usually voltage) to a digital number that represents the quantity's amplitude. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter)

### Digital Analog Converter



### Sensors

> In the broadest definition, a sensor is an object whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment, and then provide a corresponding output. A sensor is a type of transducer; sensors may provide various types of output, but typically use electrical or optical signals. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor)

### Actuators

> An actuator is a type of motor that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It is operated by a source of energy, typically electric current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure, and converts that energy into motion. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuator)

### Intellectual Property Core

> In electronic design a semiconductor intellectual property core, IP core, or IP block is a reusable unit of logic, cell, or chip layout design that is the intellectual property of one party. IP cores may be licensed to another party or can be owned and used by a single party alone. The term is derived from the licensing of the patent and/or source code copyright that exist in the design. IP cores can be used as building blocks within ASIC chip designs or FPGA logic designs. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core)

## Processor Design

> Processor design is the design engineering task of creating a microprocessor, a component of computer hardware. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_design)

## MicroProcessor

> A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor)

### Central processing unit (CPU)

> The control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single integrated circuit called a microprocessor. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)

### General Purpose Processor

> General purpose means it is not designed for any specialized purpose

## Control Unit

> The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic/logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to a program's instructions. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_unit)

## Input/output (I/O)

> In computing, input/output or I/O (or, informally, io or IO) is the communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)


# MicroController

> A microcontroller (or MCU, short for microcontroller unit) is a small computer (SoC) on a single integrated circuit containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of Ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a typically small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications consisting of various discrete chips.
