# Intellectual Property Core

> In electronic design a semiconductor intellectual property core, IP core, or IP block is a reusable unit of logic, cell, or chip layout design that is the intellectual property of one party. IP cores may be licensed to another party or can be owned and used by a single party alone. The term is derived from the licensing of the patent and/or source code copyright that exist in the design. IP cores can be used as building blocks within ASIC chip designs or FPGA logic designs. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core)



## Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)

> A digital signal processor (DSP) is a specialized microprocessor (or a SIP block), with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of digital signal processing. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor)

## Printed Circuit Board

> A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate. Components — capacitors, resistors or active devices — are generally soldered on the PCB. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)

## Analog Digital Converter

>  An analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, A–D, or A-to-D) is a device that converts a continuous physical quantity (usually voltage) to a digital number that represents the quantity's amplitude. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter)

## Sensors

> In the broadest definition, a sensor is an object whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment, and then provide a corresponding output. A sensor is a type of transducer; sensors may provide various types of output, but typically use electrical or optical signals. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor)

## Actuators

> An actuator is a type of motor that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It is operated by a source of energy, typically electric current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure, and converts that energy into motion.
