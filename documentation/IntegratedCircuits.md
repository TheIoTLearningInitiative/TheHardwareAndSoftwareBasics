# Field Programmable Gate Array

> A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing â€“ hence "field-programmable". The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). (Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs, but this is increasingly rare.) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)
